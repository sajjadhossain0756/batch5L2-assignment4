# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Book Management System

This is a full-stack web application designed to manage a collection of books, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and also to simulate borrowing them. The application is built with a React frontend using Redux Toolkit Query for API interactions and a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB for data persistence.
